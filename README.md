# Data Structures in OCaml

This project contains implementations of a few data structures in OCaml. Most of them are from the amazing [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504) by Chris Okasaki. 

The book describes several implementations of common data structures (lists, queues, heaps) as examples to concepts and techniques to work with persistent data structures in a purely functional paradigm.

The implementations are in Standard ML, so converting to OCaml is trivial. I'm just doing this for learning purposes.
